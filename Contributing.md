# Contributing to UPB Forge

First off, thank you for considering contributing to the UPB Forge framework! This project is released under the permissive MIT license and thrives on community collaboration and feedback. We appreciate any effort to help improve this tool.

## How to Contribute

The primary way to contribute at this stage is by using **GitHub Issues** in this repository. Please use issues to:

*   Report Bugs (Conceptual/Structural)
*   Suggest Enhancements or New Features
*   Propose New Prompts or Sections
*   Identify Areas for Documentation Improvement
*   Discuss Ideas or Usage Scenarios

## Types of Contributions Welcomed

*   **Bug Reports:** If you find structural issues in the HTML, inconsistencies in the instructions, typos, or prompts that consistently fail to work as described (even with capable AI and correct context), please file a detailed bug report.
*   **Prompt Suggestions:** Have an idea for a new Prompt ID that would be useful within an existing section? Propose it! Please try to follow the UPB format: define its Goal, necessary Input, expected Output, potential Persona/Constraints, and draft a Synopsis (Function, Best Use). Reference existing prompts as examples.
*   **New Section Ideas:** If you think a whole new functional area is needed, open an issue to discuss the Section's purpose, the core Persona, typical Internal Steps, and example Prompt IDs it might contain (see H4.9/H4.10 for the design concepts).
*   **Refinement Suggestions:** If you think an existing prompt, instruction, or explanation could be clearer, more effective, or better structured, please suggest specific improvements.
*   **Documentation Improvements:** If parts of the README, Usage Guide, or comments within the HTML are unclear, incorrect, or missing, please suggest improvements.
*   **Usage Examples:** Creating clear examples (like those in the `examples/` directory) demonstrating how to effectively use specific prompts or workflows is highly valuable. You can submit these as suggestions via Issues or potentially Pull Requests (see below).

## Making Good Submissions (Issues)

*   **Search First:** Check if a similar issue or suggestion already exists.
*   **Clear Title:** Use a concise and descriptive title.
*   **Detailed Description:** Explain the bug, suggestion, or idea thoroughly.
    *   For bugs: Include steps to reproduce (if applicable), expected behavior, and actual behavior.
    *   For suggestions: Explain the problem it solves or the benefit it provides, and how it might work.
*   **Context is Key:** If referring to specific prompts, use their IDs (e.g., `D2-S4.5`). Explain the context in which you were using the prompt.
*   **Be Respectful:** Adhere to the project's Code of Conduct.
