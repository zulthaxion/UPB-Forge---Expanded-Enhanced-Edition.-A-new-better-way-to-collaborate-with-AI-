# Example 1: Basic Problem Analysis (A1.5)

This example demonstrates using Section A1 (Critical Thinking) to analyze a simple problem and brainstorm solutions.

## Goal

Analyze why a small team project is facing delays and propose solutions and preventative measures.

## UPB Prompt Used

```
A1.5 Team Description: Small marketing team (3 people), usually efficient. Project X: Launch new social media campaign. Delays: Graphics keep needing revisions, copy isn't finalized.
```

## Hypothetical AI Output (Illustrative)

**(Persona: Structured Analyst and Problem Solver)**

Based on the description of the struggling marketing team working on Project X, here's an analysis:

**Potential Reasons for Delay:**

1.  **Unclear Creative Brief/Vision:** The graphics needing multiple revisions and copy not being finalized suggests the initial creative direction or requirements might have been ambiguous or poorly communicated, leading to iterative rework.
2.  **Resource Bottleneck/Overload:** With a small team of 3, if one person is responsible for both graphics and copy (or if the designated graphic designer is overloaded), they might be a bottleneck preventing timely completion.
3.  **Inefficient Review/Feedback Loop:** Delays in getting feedback on drafts, unclear feedback, or multiple rounds of conflicting feedback can significantly slow down creative production.

**Potential Solutions:**

1.  **Clarify Brief:** Hold a brief meeting (15-20 mins) *immediately* to finalize the core message, visual style requirements, and key copy points for the campaign. Document these clearly.
2.  **Task Prioritization/Load Balancing:** Assess current workloads. Can another team member assist with proofreading copy or providing faster feedback on graphic drafts, even if it's not their primary role? Prioritize the absolute essential elements needed for launch.
3.  **Streamline Feedback:** Implement a single point of contact for final approvals or use a shared document/tool where feedback is consolidated clearly and addressed batch-wise by a specific deadline.

**Plan to Prevent Future Delays:**

*   **Detailed Kick-off Document:** Ensure all future campaigns start with a clearly defined creative brief, target audience, key messages, and visual guidelines agreed upon by all stakeholders.
*   **Capacity Planning:** Before committing to deadlines, briefly assess team member bandwidth and identify potential bottlenecks early.
*   **Defined Review Process:** Establish clear timelines and methods for feedback rounds (e.g., max 2 rounds, specific feedback format) for future projects.

## Explanation & Takeaway

This shows how `A1.5` can quickly structure problem analysis. By providing minimal context (team size, project, symptoms), the AI, acting as an analyst, breaks down the problem into causes, solutions, and preventative steps, offering a structured starting point for addressing the issue. Note how the AI focuses on common project management issues relevant to the described symptoms.
