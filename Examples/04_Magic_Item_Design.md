# Example 4: Magic Item Design (G3.1)

This example uses Section G3 to design a basic magical item consistent with predefined system rules and cultural aesthetics.

## Goal

Design a simple healing item usable within an Herbalism-based 'Life-Weaving' magic system for a Forest Elf culture.

## UPB Prompt Used

```
G3.1 Item Type: Simple Healing Poultice System: Herbalism-based 'Life-Weaving' (G1 context: uses ambient life energy, costs user stamina). Culture: Forest Elves (S2 context: favor natural materials, subtle enchantments, harmony with nature). Item Name Suggestion: Sunpetal Salve
```

## Hypothetical AI Output (Illustrative)

**(Persona: Artificer, Engineer, and Artifact Lore Master [Magic/Herbalism Focus])**

Designing the 'Sunpetal Salve':

1.  **Primary Function:** When applied to minor wounds (cuts, bruises), accelerates natural healing by gently channeling ambient life energy (System G1) into the injury site. Significantly reduces healing time for minor injuries but has little effect on severe trauma or disease. (Effect ref G2).
2.  **Activation Method:** Requires the user to apply the salve physically and briefly focus their own life energy (a small but noticeable stamina cost - ref G1.9) into it, 'awakening' the latent life-weaving enchantment within the herbs.
3.  **Specific Drawback/Limitation/Cost:** Besides the stamina cost, the salve loses potency rapidly when exposed to direct sunlight for extended periods (more than an hour). It must be stored in opaque, sealed containers. Its effectiveness is reduced on non-living or deeply corrupted tissue. (Ref G1.2).
4.  **Visual Appearance:** A thick, green-gold paste stored in a smooth, dark wooden container carved with subtle leaf motifs (ref Culture S2). It smells faintly of moss and warm sunlight. When active, it might emit a very faint, warm golden glow (ref Sensory Sig G1.8).
5.  **Basic Lore/Origin Hint:** Traditionally prepared by Elven Hedge-Weavers using sun-infused petals gathered only at dawn. Considered a common household remedy, recipes passed down through families. (Ref G3.2).

## Explanation & Takeaway

This demonstrates `G3.1` creating a functional, balanced item concept. The AI integrates the requested system (Life-Weaving, stamina cost), cultural aesthetics (Forest Elf style), adds logical limitations (sunlight sensitivity), defines activation, and provides appearance/lore details, resulting in a well-grounded item ready for the Story Bible.
