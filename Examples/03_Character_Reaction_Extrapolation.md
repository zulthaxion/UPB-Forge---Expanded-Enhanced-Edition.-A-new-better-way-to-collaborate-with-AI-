# Example 3: Character Reaction Extrapolation (F3.17)

This example uses Section F3 to explore how a specific character would likely react to a world event, based on their established profile.

## Goal

Determine Kaelen Vance's likely reaction upon first encountering a manifestation of 'eht tfihs'.

## UPB Prompt Used

```
F3.17 Character: Kaelen Vance (S3 Profile Summary: Pragmatic soldier, protective of team, distrustful of unknown variables, relies on tactical assessment). Event: First unexplained encounter with a swirling, smoky negative 'eht tfihs' manifestation appearing in the corridor ahead during exploration (ref Chapter 10 events).
```

## Hypothetical AI Output (Illustrative)

**(Persona: Narrative Catalyst and Character Analyst)**

Analyzing Kaelen Vance's likely reaction to the 'eht tfihs' manifestation:

*   **a) Initial Emotional Response:** **Alertness & Threat Assessment, Masked by Professional Calm.** Vance's immediate reaction wouldn't be overt panic. Training kicks in: heightened awareness, assessing the phenomenon's boundaries, movement, and potential hostility. Internally, there would be a spike of adrenaline and deep unease due to its utterly alien nature, but outwardly he'd project tactical readiness. His default is distrust of the unknown.
*   **b) Interpretation:** **Unknown Hostile Phenomenon.** Lacking data, his pragmatic mind wouldn't jump to 'supernatural' or 'dimensional'. He'd categorize it as an unknown environmental hazard or a potential hostile entity with unknown capabilities. His primary thought: "What threat does this pose to my team *right now*?" He might suspect a new form of enemy action or a Prism-related instability based on prior events.
*   **c) Resulting Action/Decision:** **Defensive Posture & Containment Attempt (Cautious).** His immediate action: Order team to halt, take cover, establish fields of fire. He'd likely order non-lethal deterrents first (e.g., bright lights, sonic pulse if available) to test reaction without escalating unnecessarily. He would NOT rush in. He'd order sensor sweeps (if possible) and attempt to establish a safe perimeter or fallback route while observing the phenomenon's behavior, focusing entirely on team safety and situational control over scientific curiosity.

## Explanation & Takeaway

This shows `F3.17` generating a character-specific reaction grounded in their established traits (pragmatism, protectiveness, distrust from S3). The AI extrapolates how Vance's personality filters his perception and dictates his likely actions when faced with a specific, unsettling world event, making his response feel authentic and consistent.
