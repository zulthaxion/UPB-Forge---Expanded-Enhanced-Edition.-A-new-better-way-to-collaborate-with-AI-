*   **Section J:** Comprehensive section for Game Design Integration & Conceptualization, translating narrative IP into game concepts across core design (J1), systems (J2), level/encounter (J3), progression/balancing (J4), and UI/UX (J5).

*   **Section H4:** User-Guided Prompt Generation & Iteration suite (H4.0-H4.10) for creating custom prompts, analyzing drafts, getting refinement advice, and designing new UPB sections.
*   **A0-M Prompts:** Meta-context generation tools (A0-M.1 Context Bible, A0-M.2 Data Conduit, A0-M.3 HTML Replica) for session summary, state export, and data logging.
*   **Modular Template (`UPB_Forge_Modular_Template.html`):** Provided a template to facilitate the creation of smaller, focused UPB modules.
*   **Modular Context Awareness instruction** added to Global System Instructions.
*   Numerous new prompts added across existing sections (esp. D2 Stages, F, G) for enhanced functionality and detail.
*   Enhanced `README.md` and added initial `examples/` directory structure.

### Changed

*   **Global System Instructions (GSI):** Revised to v3.1, incorporating explicit "Modular Context Awareness" instructions and refining NLP fallback logic hierarchy.
*   **Prompt Synopses:** Reviewed and refined many synopses across the Bible for improved clarity and accuracy.
*   **Section Structure/Flow:** Minor adjustments to section introductions and cross-references for better navigation and coherence.
