All notable changes to the UPB Forge framework will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to Semantic Versioning (though initial versions are pre-release).

## [1.1] - 2025-05-25 

This version represents a significant overhaul of the Global System Instructions and a complete redesign of Section B2, building upon the foundational v1.0.1 release and incorporating numerous iterative improvements. The primary goal of v1.1 is to increase the dynamic adaptability, contextual intelligence, and overall collaborative power of any AI operating under the UPB Forge framework.

### Changed
- **Global System Instructions (GSI) (`#global-system-prompt`):** Major overhaul. Key enhancements include:
    - Redefined AI Core Role as "Adaptive Synthesis Agent" for more dynamic user NLP interaction.
    - Improved clarity on prioritizing user NLP to mold Prompt ID execution.
    - Strengthened emphasis on proactive tool integration (`google_search`, `tool_code`).
    - Explicit designation of `A0-M.1`, `A0-M.2`, `A0-M.3` as special triggers for session artifact generation.
    - Instructions for AI to actively utilize L2 Conceptual Index logic for user guidance.
    - Refined NLP handling for non-ID requests with clearer logic and L2 navigation.
    - More nuanced guidance on viewpoint neutrality and guided subjectivity.
    - Sharpened definition of the overall goal for AI collaboration.
- **Section B2: Consolidated Actionable Experts & Verbs (`#B2`):** Completely redesigned.
    - Transformed from a simple verb list into "Actionable Experts" with functional definitions (e.g., "Adapt - Act as a Contextual Transformer").
    - Each entry now explains its function and application, enhancing understanding of prompt intent.
- **Versioning:** Document title and internal references updated to `v1.1`.

### Added
- *(If there are features in v1.1 that were **not** present in any form in v1.0.1 or the incremental versions, list them here. For example, if A0-M.3 or Section A6 were entirely new concepts in v1.1 compared to the original v1.0.1 feature set, they would go here. If they were present in v1.0.1 and merely refined in GSI for v1.1, they stay under "Changed" or "Fixed".)*
  *Example placeholder for genuinely new v1.1 features if any:*
  * *New XYZ functionality for enhanced collaboration.*

### Fixed
- This release rolls up all hotfixes, general improvements, typographical corrections, and minor functional refinements made incrementally since the v1.0.1 release.

## [1.0.1] - 2025-05-05 

### Added
*   **Section I:** Comprehensive section for Coding, Development & Education, including concept explanation (I1), code generation/debugging (I2), and guided learning (I3). Integrates `tool_code` execution concepts.
*   **Section J:** Comprehensive section for Game Design Integration & Conceptualization, translating narrative IP into game concepts across core design (J1), systems (J2), level/encounter (J3), progression/balancing (J4), and UI/UX (J5).
*   **Section A6:** Dedicated Context Management & Retrieval tools (A6.1-A6.4) to help users actively manage session context with the AI.
*   **Section H4:** User-Guided Prompt Generation & Iteration suite (H4.0-H4.10) for creating custom prompts, analyzing drafts, getting refinement advice, and designing new UPB sections.
*   **A0-M Prompts:** Meta-context generation tools (A0-M.1 Context Bible, A0-M.2 Data Conduit, A0-M.3 HTML Replica) for session summary, state export, and data logging.
*   **Modular Template (`UPB_Forge_Modular_Template.html`):** Provided a template to facilitate the creation of smaller, focused UPB modules.
*   **Modular Context Awareness instruction** added to Global System Instructions.
*   Numerous new prompts added across existing sections (esp. D2 Stages, F, G) for enhanced functionality and detail.
*   Enhanced `README.md` and added initial `examples/` directory structure.

### Changed
*   **Global System Instructions (GSI):** Revised to v3.1 (initial numbering for 1.0.1 GSI), incorporating explicit "Modular Context Awareness" instructions and refining NLP fallback logic hierarchy.
*   **Prompt Synopses:** Reviewed and refined many synopses across the Bible for improved clarity and accuracy.
*   **Section Structure/Flow:** Minor adjustments to section introductions and cross-references for better navigation and coherence.
